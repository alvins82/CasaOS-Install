# Changelog

All notable changes to the CasaOS fork installer are documented here.

## [0.4.25] - 2026-08-12

### Changed

- Pin CasaOS LocalStorage `v0.4.21`, which excludes system storage from merged `/DATA` branches.
- Pin CasaOS UI `v0.4.27`, which labels system storage as excluded and keeps system AppData available at `/DATA/AppData`.
- Publish a complete platform-neutral installer bundle for amd64, arm64, and arm/v7.

### Fixed

- Preserve the existing system data tree while moving `/DATA` onto external mergerfs storage.
- Keep the fork release marker and update manifest aligned so the CasaOS dashboard can discover and apply this release.

## [0.4.22] - 2026-08-12

### Changed

- Pin CasaOS UI `v0.4.26` for the qBittorrent top-level launch behavior.
